# RADIUS Vulnerability Detector

This script detects the CVE-2024-3596 vulnerability in RADIUS/UDP traffic by checking for MD5 collisions. It captures RADIUS Access-Request packets and attempts to generate MD5 collisions to determine if the system is vulnerable.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library
- `pyrad` library

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can check your Python version with:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

2. Install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip3 install scapy pyrad
    ```

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file, for example `radius_vulnerability_detector.py`.

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python3 radius_vulnerability_detector.py
    ```

3. Provide the necessary inputs when prompted:
   - **Shared secret**: The shared secret between the RADIUS server and clients.
   - **Network interface**: The network interface to listen on (e.g., `eth0`).
   - **RADIUS dictionary path**: The full path to your RADIUS dictionary file.

## Example

```bash
$ python3 radius_vulnerability_detector.py
Enter the shared secret: your_shared_secret
Enter the network interface (e.g., eth0): eth0
Enter the path to your RADIUS dictionary: /path/to/your/dictionary


The script will capture RADIUS Access-Request packets and analyze them for MD5 collisions. If a collision is detected, it will indicate that your system may be vulnerable to CVE-2024-3596.
